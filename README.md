## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

* Search for words using the input field
* See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
* See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
* Play the audio file for a word when it's available
* Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
* Switch between light and dark themes
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the pages
